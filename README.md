Use any email and password to get the home screen.

To use this project, follow these instructions:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to create a new Next.js app using this starter template:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --use-npm --example "https://github.com/fredybustos/next-starter"
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

4. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Configure Authentication:

To configure authentication with NextAuth.js, you will need to provide your own authentication providers and credentials.

For more information on setting up authentication with NextAuth.js, refer to the [NextAuth.js documentations](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction)

6. Start the development server:

```bash

```
The application will be running at http://localhost:3000. You can access it in your web browser.
